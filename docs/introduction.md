# What is FCR (Frontend Component Repository)?

As the home page suggests, FCR stands for repository of frontend components.

These UI components are all business components which are commonly used in my frontend projects.(Roughly referenced above 100+ times ).

At the aim of managing them and making them more reusable among different projects, I decided to create a such repository. On the other side, the repository is also a witness of my working experience.

As an open source repository, no matter whether the components can be used in your project or not, I sincerely hope you can provide some feedbacks or suggestions. It is also a welcome if you can take part in and become one of the contributors.

It is also my goal to achieve three versions of every component: element-plus, element-ui and antd. However, my most time is spent on working. In this case maybe a component's other version is not available currently but I will try my best to make it.

You can check the following chapters to see the progress.

## Finished

- <h3>form-dialog (element-ui)</h3>

  - Form embed in a dialog.

  - commonly used situations: edit or create a form without creating a page.

## Ongoing

- dialog form (element-plus, antd)

## To do

- member-selector (element-ui)
